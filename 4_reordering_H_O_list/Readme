We will do the check_1 first, if it has something wrong! we than will move to check_2.
In check_2, we need to modify the code inside in order tp get the right one.
As we assume that there will be no water dissociations during our simulations.
If the water dissociate frequently in our simulation time, then the code is not suitable for this situation. 

In this file, we only need the Final_reduced_H_list from 2.

The parameters that we need to input:
total_proton_num=`echo 2`

This file will help to re order the prootn bonded O list in our file.
