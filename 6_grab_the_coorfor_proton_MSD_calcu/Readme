This script deals with grabing the proton bonded oxygen coordinations here.
We have separated the diffusion coefficient into the xy-palne, z-dir and total.

The files we need is Final_O_uporder_list_Final from 4, and XDATCAR & POSCAR from 2

##################################################################
The command that we need to perform:
sbatch Submit.run
[Inside there you need to define the steps you need to deduct from your trajectory]
[After this finished]

cd xy_plane_MSD
sbatch Submit.run

##################################################################
We need to modify something in the Submit_first.run:
#The former steps we need to cut from our SDATCAR file
needed_step=`echo 15000`

The parameters we need to set to the following files:
graping_two_proton_binded_O_position_out.sh
#How many protons are studied in the system
total_proton_num=`echo 2`

You need to modify in both files.
