This is the script to grab all water O position in trajectory (including the water containing hydronium ion).
We have separated the diffusion coefficient into the xy-plane, Z-dir and total.

The files we need are XDATCAR and POSCAR from 2.

##################################################################
The command that we need to perform:
sbatch Submit.run
[Inside there you need to define the steps you need to deduct from
[After this finished]

cd xy_plane_MSD
sbatch Submit.run

##################################################################
We need to modify something in the Submit_first.run:
#The former steps we need to cut from our SDATCAR file
needed_step=`echo 15000`

The parameters we need to set to the following files:
graping_two_proton_binded_O_position_out.sh
#Definition of variables
#The O index in water
WO_St=`echo 65`
WO_En=`echo 76`
interger_WO=`echo 1`
#if the water O dosen't have the order than we can define the O index as following:
#WaterO=(115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126)

You need to modify in both files.
