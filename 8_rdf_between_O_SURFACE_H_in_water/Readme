This is the script to get the trajectory of the surface O and the H (inclduing the protons) Water layer.
Then we will use this trajectory in the second_gr_SO_HPW.

The file we need is the XDATCAR and POSCAR from 2.

##################################################################
The command that we need to perform:
sbatch Submit.run
[Inside, you need to define the steps you need to use from the trajectory]
[After this finished]

We need to transfer the trajectory to the second_gr_SO_HPW/data
sbatch Submit.run

##################################################################
We need to modify something in the Submit.run in first_generate_traj:
#The former steps we need to cut from our SDATCAR file
needed_step=`echo 15000`

And in the second_gr_SO_HPW file:
We will use the "Rings" program from the "http://rings-code.sourceforge.net/" 
You will need to modify some files inside in order to get the rdf of the file.
option
my_input
data/traj
All these three files we need to modify.

##################################################################
We need to modify some parameters:
#Definition of variables
#The O index at interfaical surface
SO_St=`echo 33`
SO_En=`echo 64`
interger_SO=`echo 1`
#If the surface O index does not have an order
#SurfaceO=(83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,101,103,105,107,109,111,113)

#For the index of proton or H in water layer
#if the index has an order
H_St=`echo 125`
H_En=`echo 150`
interger_H=`echo 1`
#If the index does not have an order
WaterHP=(125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140)
