This is the script to get the trajectory of the Water O.
Then we will use this trajectory final_pos_WO in the second_gr_SO_HPW

The file we need is the XDATCAR and POSCAR from 2.

The command that we need to perform:
sbatch Submit.run
[Inside, you need to define the steps you need to use from the trajectory]
[After this finished]

We need to transfer the trajectory to the second_gr_SO_HPW/data
sbatch Submit.run

##################################################################
We need to modify something in the Submit.run in first_generate_traj:
#The former steps we need to cut from our SDATCAR file
needed_step=`echo 15000`

And in the second_gr_SO_HPW file:
We will use the "Rings" program from the "http://rings-code.sourceforge.net/" 
You will need to modify some files inside in order to get the rdf of the file.
option
my_input
data/traj
All these three files we need to modify.

##################################################################
We need to modify some parameters:
#Definition of variables
#The index in the water O
WO_St=`echo 65`
WO_En=`echo 76`
interger_WO=`echo 1`
#If the water O does not have an order
#WaterO=(115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126)
